I created a few renders using models of kalediedoscopes as described in Don Doak's patent after reading [Wayne Schmidt's post](http://www.waynesthisandthat.com/kaleidoscopes2.html) on kaleidoscopes. Below I have also included a few images of the pictures I took with a kaleidoscope and some EL wire for aesthetic experimenting.
